> **Content Update 3.3.0 -- Path of Exile: Incursion**
>
> **The Incursion Challenge League**
>
> * Challenge leagues are a great opportunity for a fresh start in a new economy. All of your old characters and items are still present in the Standard and Hardcore leagues, but you're encouraged to join the new leagues, complete challenges and demonstrate your mastery of Path of Exile!
>
> * With 3.3.0, there are Standard and Hardcore, and Solo Self-Found Standard and Hardcore, variations of the Incursion challenge league available. They have the same core mechanics and items.
>
> * In the Incursion Challenge League, explorer Alva Valai is searching for the ancient Vaal treasure temple of Atzoatl. Travel back in time to discover the location of the temple and change its history to maximise your reward.
>
> * Each time you encounter Alva in the wilderness, she can open a time portal, allowing you to visit the Temple of Atzoatl during its construction. Your brief visit can be extended by laying waste to its inhabitants. These visits allow Alva to learn its location in the present day, and allow you to influence its contents and reap its rewards.
>
> * After 11 Temporal Incursions, Alva will have narrowed down the present-day location of the Temple of Atzoatl. Together, you can explore the jungle, discover the temple and claim its treasures. Each type of room in the temple has its own unique risks and rewards.
>
> * Your actions in the past have significant consequences. By killing the Vaal Architects who guide the temple's construction, you can influence what rooms appear in the present-day version. During your Incursions, you may find keys that can be used to unlock doors in the past, allowing access to additional rooms in the future.
>
> * By traveling into the past and influencing the Vaal Architects to upgrade the rooms they are building, you can access even greater treasures. Many upgraded rooms come with rewards worthy of the significant danger they introduce into the temple.
>
> * The new challenge leagues include a set of 40 new challenges. When you complete 12 challenges, you will receive the Incursion Bandana. At 24, you will receive the Incursion Cloak. When you complete your 36th challenge, you will receive the Incursion Portal Effect. These microtransactions are only obtainable in this league.
>
> * From the 19th challenge onwards and for every third challenge after that, you will receive pieces of the Incursion Totem Pole decoration to display in your hideout. The Totem Pole permanently showcases how many of the Incursion challenges you completed during the league.
>
> **Major New Content and Features**
>
> * Added a new Strength gem - Vaal Earthquake: Smash the ground, dealing damage in an area and cracking the earth. The crack will erupt in a powerful aftershock after a short delay. Your steps will deal damage around you for a duration, cracking the earth if the previous cracks have erupted.
>
> * Added a new Intelligence gem - Vaal Blight: Apply a powerful debuff which deals chaos damage over time to enemies around. Then apply two additional layers in a larger area, growing greatly in size each time. Enemies are also substantially hindered, slowing their movement for a shorter secondary duration.
>
> * Added a new Dexterity gem - Vaal Blade Vortex: Create an independently-moving vortex of ethereal blades which last for a duration. The vortex moves towards nearby enemies, repeatedly damaging enemies that it passes through.
>
> * Added a new Strength/Intelligence gem - Vaal Impurity of Fire: Casts an aura that reduces fire damage taken and provides ignite immunity to you and nearby allies, and makes hits against nearby enemies ignore their fire resistance.
>
> * Added a new Dexterity/Intelligence gem - Vaal Impurity of Ice: Casts an aura that reduces cold damage taken and provides freeze and chill immunity to you and nearby allies, and makes hits against nearby enemies ignore their cold resistance.
>
> * Added a new Intelligence gem - Vaal Impurity of Lightning: Casts an aura that reduces lightning damage taken and provides shock immunity to you and nearby allies, and makes hits against nearby enemies ignore their lightning resistance.
>
> * Added a new Dexterity/Intelligence gem - Charged Traps Support: Supported trap skills have a chance to gain frenzy and power charges when your traps are triggered by an enemy. Also grants increased trap throwing speed per frenzy charge and added critical strike multiplier for traps per power charge.
>
> * Added a new Dexterity/Intelligence gem - Flamethrower Trap: Throw a trap that releases a number of flames in different directions around it when triggered. The flames last for a duration, rotating around the trap and repeatedly dealing damage. Burning enemies are dealt more damage.
>
> * Added a new Dexterity/Intelligence gem - Seismic Trap: Throw a trap which, once triggered, repeatedly releases a number of waves for a duration. Each wave deals damage in a series of small bursts in a line, ending with a larger burst. Modifiers to cast speed affect how frequently it releases waves.
>
> * Added a new Dexterity/Intelligence gem - Explosive Trap: Throw a trap that creates a large explosion when triggered, dealing spell damage in an area. A number of smaller explosions occur around this area in quick succession after the first.
>
> * Added a new Intelligence/Dexterity gem - Siphoning Trap: Throw a trap that applies debuff beams to a number of nearby enemies for a duration. The beams chill and deal cold damage over time. A beam is also applied to you, granting life and mana regeneration based on the number of debuff beams affecting enemies.
>
> * Added a new Intelligence/Dexterity gem - Lightning Spire Trap: Throw a trap which, once triggered, will repeatedly strike multiple areas around it for a duration, dealing lightning damage. Modifiers to cast speed affects how frequently it strikes. Has a higher chance to critically strike shocked enemies.

>
> * Added a new feature - Always Attack Without Moving: This feature prevents your character from moving while using skills where this is toggled on, as if you are holding down your "Attack in Place" key. This can be toggled on and off of individual skills in the skill bar. This feature can also be used on movement skills to prevent the skill from "namelocking" (ie. locking onto an enemy).
>
> **Minor New Content and Features**
>
> * Added 39 new Labyrinth Enchantments for existing skills, and 43 for new skills. Enchantments for existing skills which have undergone significant reworking may not appear any more due to mechanical changes making them nonfunctional, such as enchantments which modify the cooldown of trap skills. Existing versions of these enchantments will now grant increased damage with that skill at the same value.
>
> * Added 6 dangerous new Nemesis mods.
>
> * Added 8 new Grandmasters to the Hall of Grandmasters unique map, and replaced 2 existing ones.

>
> * Targets for the Pale Council Prophecy chains now show up on the minimap.

>
> * Made several skill performance optimisations, most notably Molten Strike's performance at high projectile volumes.
>
> * World and Map areas can now have multiple sub-areas. This means you can now, for example, find a Zana mission in the same map as a Labyrinth trial, Abyssal Depths, or an Elder Guardian. Please note that only the most recently opened sub-area of any given area will stay open indefinitely, and others will eventually expire as if it were any other inactive instance. Expired sub-areas become inaccessible, rather than simply resetting.
>
> * The item filter now supports sorting by gem levels, stack sizes and explicit item mods.
>
> * You can now filter the social panel with Ctrl+F.
>
> * Updated the Loreweave, Kingmaker, and The Taming vendor recipes to give Shaper and Elder results if all the inputs were Shaper or Elder items. Elder/Shaper Breach items now also maintain their status if they are transformed with a Blessing.
>
> * Continued to incrementally improve the sound, art, effects and environments.
>
> **Character Balance**
>
> * Modifiers to skill duration no longer modify the duration of traps, totems or mines, but will continue to modify the duration of skills cast by traps, totems and mines if those skills have a duration.
>
> * Ignite now deals 50% of the igniting hit's damage per second over 4 seconds (up from 40% per second).
>
> * You can now have up to 15 traps active at a time (up from 3).
>
> **Skill Balance**
>
> * Supports which cause skills to create traps, totems or mines will no longer grant that skill the duration tag.
>
> **Traps**
>
> * The interaction between trap skills with cooldowns and sources of additional traps thrown (such as the Multiple Traps or Cluster Trap Supports) has been changed, and now work as they did with Vaal Lightning Trap previously. Namely, additional traps can only be thrown if the skill has at least one extra trap cooldown stockpiled, and only as many additional traps will be thrown as there are cooldowns stockpiled. In other words, if you have three Seismic Traps stockpiled and have the Shaper's additional trap glove mod, you'll throw two traps and consume two Seismic Trap cooldowns. If you only have two cooldowns stockpiled and attempt to throw three Seismic Traps via the Multitrap support, you will only throw two traps.
>
> * As a result of this change to trap cooldowns, the following trap skills no longer have a cooldown: Fire Trap, Lightning Trap, Ice Trap.
>
> * The trap model has been updated.
>
> **Fire Trap**

> * No longer has a cooldown.

>
> * Base duration of the burning ground is now 1.75 seconds (down from 8 seconds).
>
> * Now has 1% increased fire damage per 1% gem quality (previously had 3% increased burning damage per 2% gem quality).
>
> * Now deals added fire damage against burning enemies.
>
> * Now has an added damage effectiveness of 200% (up from 100%).
>
> **Bear Trap**

This movement speed gradually recovers back to normal over the course of the debuff's duration.

If the target dies while debuffed, it explodes, dealing 6% of the monster's base maximum life to nearby enemies, plus 66% of base attack damage per debuff. At 6 stacks of the debuff, the target explodes for 66% of base attack damage per debuff and the debuffs are consumed. Monsters slain by this explosion will still explode, dealing damage based on its life.

>
> * There were two primary goals with the passive tree adjustments: Provide more power to ignite builds without providing more power to other burning damage builds, and rebalance trap and mine passives. To that end, most of the reductions to trap and mine passives occur to trap throwing speed and mine placement speed. This was to bring them more closely in line with cast speed. Trap cooldown recovery was also targeted, as many bread-and-butter traps no longer have cooldowns, and the traps introduced in this patch are strong enough to warrant their longer cooldowns.

> * Primordial Harmony: Now grants your golems 30-45% increased cooldown recovery speed, to compensate for a bug that was fixed. Existing versions of this jewel can be updated with a Divine Orb.
>
> * Atziri's Reign: Now has a limit of 2. Existing copies of this jewel will automaticaly be updated to have this limit.
>
> * Perandus Manor: Now has a 100% chance to spawn Cadiro Perandus somewhere in it.
>
> * Xoph's Inception: Now proliferates Ignites in a radius of 15 (up from 12). Existing versions of this item can be updated with a Divine Orb.
>
> * Winter's Bounty: Now changes the skill from generating and having a cooldown override of Frenzy Charges to Power Charges. It now has a limit of 1. Existing copies of this jewel will automatically be updated to this new behaviour.
>
> * Bubonic Trail: Now has a neat new effect.
>
> **Monster Balance**
>
> * Added two new monster types to the Control Blocks in Act 10, as well as to maps. Several existing Kitava-themed monsters have also been added to maps.
>
> * Monsters which use Detonate Dead and Vaal Detonate Dead have been updated to use a version similar to the one used by Alira and Tolman in maps.
>
> * Shivershell now telegraphs that he will use his Detonate Dead skill before he uses it.
>
> * All versions of Alira now have a shorter cast time for her Detonate Dead.
>
> * Normal and Magic monsters from Breaches now drop significantly fewer items.
>
> * The boss of Thicket, The Primal One, no longer has a cooldown on his sunder when he enrages.
>
> * Several monsters which raised zombies were incorrectly using the player version of the skill, resulting in very strong zombies capable of slamming. They've been swapped over to a different version of the skill.
>
> * The attack range of Desecrated Thralls (Kitava's skeletons) has been increased by 25%.
>
> * Na'em, Bending Stone now deals the same damage with his projectiles at all ranges. The damage has been lowered by 30% to compensate. This skill now has a 4 second cooldown.

>
> **Map Balance**
>
> * Once you have completed 20 maps while the Elder and its guardians are on your atlas without actually defeating any of them, there is a chance for the Elder and its guardians to disappear and remove the Elder-influence from the maps they were on. This will make it difficult to maintain an "Elder Ring", but will also allow players who weren't capable of defeating the Elder or its guardians to clear them from their atlas.
>
> * Shaper memory fragments XI through to XV no longer require you to defeat the Elder or its guardians in specific map tiers. Instead, defeating each guardian and the elder within ANY red-tier map will get you one of these fragments.
>
> * You can no longer get Shaper memory fragments XI through to XV from a map if you are not the map's owner.
>
> * Zana's Onslaught mod now also increases monster movement speed. Previously, this was not the case.
>
> * Pit of the Chimera is now more linear. Has slightly fewer monsters on average now to compensate.
>
> * Crystal Ore is also now more linear and has had its monster spawns slightly reduced to compensate.
>
> * The Vaal Temple map can no longer roll the Twinned mod or have the Deadly Twins prophecy trigger on it.
>
> * Malformation's layout has been significantly reworked to be more pleasant to run.
>
> * The magic monsters in the Burial Chambers boss room won't spawn so close to the entrance now.
>
> * The Perandus Manor is once again on the Atlas, connected to Chateau.

>
> **Bug Fixes**
>
> * Fixed a bug where Soul Eater's buff description said it granted physical damage reduction and elemental resistances when it doesn't.
>
> * Fixed a bug where Sentari's Answer on an Animated Guardian owned by a player who also had Sentari's Answer and Necromantic Aegis would result in unintendedly high-level curses.
>
> * Fixed a bug where stats added to a skill by skill-specific mods would be copied to minions created by that skill. This caused a variety of unintended effects, the most notable of which was the cooldown modifier to Golem skills found on the unique jewel Primordial Harmony. In addition to its regular effect, the cooldown modifier was carried through to the Golem's cooldown skills, lowering those cooldowns as well.
>
> * Fixed a client crash that could occur during the Kitava encounter when Kitava hurls burning planks.
>
> * Fixed a bug where Yugul would fail to correctly transition between his various phases.
>
> * Fixed a bug where tutorial pages could retain their 'unread' exclamation marks even after being read.
>
> * Fixed a bug where shield crab shells would spontaneously vanish once knocked off.
>
> * Fixed a bug where Arakaali could become immune and unkillable if she hid while at extremely low life.
>
> * Fixed a bug with the Wither skill in which the duration of the debuffs it was applying were not being modified by all of the correct modifiers.
>
> * Fixed a bug where certain support combinations could allow Arcane Surge to support and trigger from attacks. This was unintended.
>
> * Fixed a bug where Arcane Surge would appear to not be able to support traps, totems and mines when viewing gem links when it in fact can.
>
> * Fixed some display issues with the Microtransactions Shop UI and other UI elements.
>
> * Fixed a crash that could occur while using Arborix, Augyre or Vulconus.
>
> * Fixed a bug where the Occultist's Forbidden Power would only grant a power charge once during sustained channelling, not every time the mana threshold was crossed.
>
> * Fixed a bug where weapon-swapping a weapon with Cremation while you had an instance of Cremation active would cause the Cremation to remain visually but actually stop functioning (now it will correctly disappear).
>
> * Fixed a bug where Izaro could introduce Argus after the player had already snuck in and killed Izaro's most loyal friend.
>
> * Fixed a bug where shrines could spawn atop rocks in the Vastiri Desert and Foothills areas (and other areas that used those tilesets).
>
> * Fixed a bug where Yeena's fireflies could spawn in unreachable locations.
>
> * Fixed a bug where the Rebirth prophecy could cause Bannon to become unrescuable in Act 10.
>
> * Fixed a bug where Doedre could occasionally use a skill while changing forms, causing the skill to come from an invisible entity.
>
> * Fixed a rare bug that could cause you to still have the Bandit Quest on your quest tracker despite already having Eramir's 2 skill point reward from completing that quest.
>
> * Fixed a bug which could cause you to not automatically be offered one of two quest rewards in Act 9 on turn-in.
>
