Level 1 Cast when Damage Taken + Level 20 Arcane Surge + Level 20 Fireball.<br>
<br>
Fireball's level is too high to be triggered by Cast when Damage Taken, therefore it can only be self-cast. Prior to this fix, when you'd cast Fireball, Arcane Surge would not apply its buff. After this fix, Arcane Surge will apply its buff.
